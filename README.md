# Market Lotus Price

A simple app displaying the market price of an Unlimited edition Black Lotus from Richard Garfield's 'Magic: The Gathering' card game.

## Getting Started

The JS is a single fetch function calling json data for an unlimited (2nd edition) Black Lotus, the contents of which are then used to define the image and price of the card on the front-end.
